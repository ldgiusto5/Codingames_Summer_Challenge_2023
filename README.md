# Codingames_Summer_Challenge_2023

These are my scripts of this Codingames Summer Challenge 2023
I don't have much time on this challenge because I have been working but I would like to try it.
According to the instructions, this challenge consists of 10 exercises, one more difficult than the previous one. 
The exercises are separated by folders where I will put the statement and the solution script in C. 
Although most of them I will not finish them due to the short time of the challenge and my time at work I will try to put all the statements.
I hope it will help you.
